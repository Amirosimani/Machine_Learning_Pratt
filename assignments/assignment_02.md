# Assignment 02 - Supervised Learning


## Description

In this project, you will build a **red wine quality classifier** using supervised machine learning techniques discussed during the class.


## Data

The dataset used in this project is the [Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.


## Solution

Your solution should have the following steps:

1. **Exploratory data analysis:** check columns to understand datatypes, value ranges, find possible missing values, the correlation between features, and create relevant data visualization
2.  **Modeling**:
    * create a sklearn pipeline  that includes preprocessing steps such as scaling and one hot encoding of categorical variable.
    *  train a **Linear learner** (like logistic regression) classfier and report the performance using confusion matrix
    *  train a**non-linear classifer** (like random forrest) and report the performance using confusion matrix.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Pick the model with the highest F1 score and run agrid search to improve the result. Report the best set of parameters.

4. Use the best model from step 3 to create a function that takes a single row of test data and predict the quality of wine. It should looklike something like below.

```
def wine_quality(row, model):
   """
   Main function to take a sample data and use a trained model to predict wine quality

   row: sample data
   model: ensemble model you have already trained
   """
   
   result = model.predict(row)
   
   return result

```


## Submission
Make sure your notebook as formatted, is commented and has enough written information for anyone to follow your process (use markdown cells).
