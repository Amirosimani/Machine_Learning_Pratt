# Assignment 04 - Neural Networks

## Description

This assignment has two sections. Each section has multiple parts with their respective point in parentheses. 

* First part is to build on what you have already done for **assignment 02**. Using the same `wine quality` data, build a neural net classifier with 2 hidden layers and report the classifier performance using percision and recall. You are free to use any number of parameters, optimizer, dropout ratio, and so on. (40%)

* The second part is to classify images using CNN. The dataset for this excersise is [food images](https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/food41). (60%) Feel free to experiment with all the parameters like layer size, number of convolution layer, filter size, etc. 

Please note that based on the size of your model and your laptop configuration, each epoch might take a few hours to finish. It will be helpful to run all the steps from data processing to training on a small subset of the data first (100 images). Once you confirmed that your code works, then you can run using all of the data.  

## Submission
Make sure your notebook is formatted, commented, and has enough written information for anyone to follow your process (use markdown cells). Similar to the previous assignment, follow the suggested folder structure.
