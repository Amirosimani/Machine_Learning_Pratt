# Assignment 04 - Neural Networks

## Description

This assignment has two sections. Each section has multiple parts with their respective point in parentheses. 

* First part is to build on what you have already done for **assignment 02 and 03**. Using the same `credit card approval` data, build a neural net classifier with 2 hidden layers and report the classifier performance using percision and recall. You are free to use any number of parameters, optimizer, dropout ratio, and so on. (40%)

* The second part is to classify images using CNN. The dataset for this excersise is [food images](https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/food41). (60%) Feel free to experiment with all the parameters like layer size, number of convolution layer, filter size, etc.

## Submission
Make sure your notebook is formatted, commented, and has enough written information for anyone to follow your process (use markdown cells). Similar to the previous assignment, follow the suggested folder structure.
