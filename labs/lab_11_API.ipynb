    "Application Program Interfaces, or APIs, are commonly used to retrieve data from remote websites. Sites like Twitter, and Facebook  offer certain data through their APIs. To use an API, you make a request to a remote web server, and retrieve the data you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "An API makes it easy for developers to integrate one app with another.  They expose some of a program's inner workings in a limited way.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use APIs to get information from other programs or to automate things you normally do in your web browser. Sometimes you can use APIs to do things you just can't do any other way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why I should use APIs?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data is changing quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You want a small piece of a much larger set of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is repeated computation involved. \n",
    "\n",
    "- An example of this is stock price data. It doesn't really make sense to regenerate a dataset and download it every minute -- this will take a lot of bandwidth, and be pretty slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reddit comments are one example. What if you want to just pull your own comments on Reddit? It doesn't make much sense to download the entire Reddit database, then filter just your own comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Spotify has an API that can tell you the genre of a piece of music. You could theoretically create your own classifier, and use it to categorize music, but you'll never have as much data as Spotify does."
