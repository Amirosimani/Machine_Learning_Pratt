This is certainly a good approach if the outliers are due to an error of some kind (measurement error, data corruption, etc.), however often the source of the outliers is unclear. There are many situations where occasional ‘extreme’ events cause an outlier that is outside the usual distribution of the dataset but is a valid measurement and not due to an error. In these situations, the choice of how to deal with the outliers is not necessarily clear and the choice has a significant impact on the results of any statistical analysis done on the dataset. The decision about how to deal with outliers depends on the goals and context of the research and should be detailed in any explanation about the methodology.\n",
