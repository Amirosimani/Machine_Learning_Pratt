    "\n",
    "With more powerful infrastructure for holding that data and training the models (mainly thanks to the cloud), we have become increasingly good at training deep neural networks to learn a very accurate mapping from inputs to outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, models have become increasingly larger (billions of parameters) and more and more labeled data has become available.In recent years, models have become increasingly larger (billions of parameters) and more and more labeled data has become available.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, those models are usually trained on a specific dataset and for a specific task. In real world, you deal with messy data and new scenarios, many of which your model has not encountered during training and for which it is in turn ill-prepared to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to transfer knowledge to new conditions is generally known as **transfer learning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1 shows a classic supervised learning scenario. You train a model for some task and domain A, assuming that labeled data for the same task and domain is provided.  On another occasion, when given data for some other task or domain B, we require again labeled data of the same task or domain that we can use to train a new model B so that we can expect it to perform well on this data.\n",

    "### Steps of Transfer Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer learning consists of taking features learned on one problem, and leveraging them on a new, similar problem. Transfer learning is usually done for tasks where your dataset has too little data to train a full-scale model from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, features from a model that has learned to identify racoons may be useful to kick-start a model meant to identify possoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common transfer learning workflow consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Take layers from a previously trained model.\n",
    "* Freeze them, so as to avoid destroying any of the information they contain during future training rounds.\n",
    "* Add some new, trainable layers on top of the frozen layers. They will learn to turn the old features into predictions on a new dataset.\n",
    "* Train the new layers on your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "A last, optional step, is fine-tuning, which consists of unfreezing the entire model you obtained above (or part of it), and re-training it on the new data with a very low learning rate. This can potentially achieve meaningful improvements, by incrementally adapting the pretrained features to the new data."
