    "Natural language processing (NLP) is the ability of a computer program to understand human language as it is spoken and written.\n",
    "\n",
    "Language is considered **unstructured** data. Unstructured data is information that is not arranged according to a preset data model or schema, and therefore cannot be stored in a traditional relational database (think excel files).\n",
    "Almost most of the data generated and collected is unstructured.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/lab_10_nlp_history.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A main challenge in NLP is how to represent text as data that is consumable by the computer understands.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main phases to natural language processing: **data representation** and **algorithm development**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data representation\n",
    "In order to perform machine learning on text documents, we first need to turn the text content into numerical feature vectors. There are mulitple approaches this can be done, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tokenization**: This is when text is broken down into smaller units to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/lab_10_tokenization.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "After you decided on your tokenization strategy, you have to preprocess the tokens. Here are a few common preprocessing approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lowercasing**: lowercase all the text data\n",
    "* **Stop Word Removal**:This is when common words are removed from text so unique words that offer the most information about the text remain.\n",
    "* **Lemmatization & Stemming**: This is when words are reduced to their root forms to process.\n",
    "* **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**: This is when words are marked based on the part-of speech they are -- such as nouns, verbs and adjectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Still, how can we turn these tokens to numbers that retain their meaning?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **one-hot encoding**:\n",
    " on-hot encode each word in the sentence. The steps are as follow:\n",
    "    * First, create a list with the size of our vocabulary.\n",
    "    * Assign 1 one for words that exists in the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "|        | chase | dog | person | word | ... |\n",

    "* Place a value to represent the frequency in which the word appears in the given document\n",

    "| chase | cat | dog | his | person | my | word | ... |\n",

    "| 1     | 0   | 2   | 1   | 0      | 1  | 0    | 0   |\n",
    "\n",
    "The output vector is `[1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, ...]`\n",
    "\n",
    "* This approach captures `shallow` semantics i.e. If two sentences have similar vocabulary, the two vectors that represent them are close in the vector space and they might have similar meanings.\n",
    "* The generated matrix is less sparse compared to one-hot encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still it is sparse, doesn't fully capture the semantics (`My dog is chasing his dog` vs `His dog is chasing my dog`)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Word Embeddings**: \n",
    "\n",
    "A technique to represent words in low-dimensional dense vectors while capturing the relationship between the words in the vector space.\n",
